# solid principles of object orient design

- **S** single responsibility principle (srp)
- **O** open closed principle (ocp)
- **L** liskov substitution principle (lsp)
- **I** interface segregation principle (isp)
- **D** dependency inversion principle (dip)

## srp - single responsibility principle

> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job

## ocp - open closed principle

> objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification

## lsp - liskov substitution principle

> let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type t. then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type s where s is a subtype of t

## isp - interface segregation principle

> a client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use

## dip - dependency inversion principle

> entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
